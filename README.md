## About me
Slides for this section can be found [here](https://slides.com/utstikkar/introtopython-aboutme).

## The Python Programming Language
Slide deck for this entire section is available [here](https://slides.com/utstikkar/introtopython-pythonproglanguage).

### Why Python?
Slides on this topic start [here](http://slides.com/utstikkar/introtopython-pythonproglanguage#/1)

### Python for DS Components
Slides on this topic start [here](http://slides.com/utstikkar/introtopython-pythonproglanguage#/5)

### Python 2 vs. Python 3
Slides on this topic start [here](http://slides.com/utstikkar/introtopython-pythonproglanguage#/6)

A great [ipython notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rasbt/python_reference/blob/master/tutorials/key_differences_between_python_2_and_3.ipynb) covering the main differences has been written by Sebastian Raschka.

To keep your code compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3, you might also want to use [this Cheat Sheet](http://python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html#cheat-sheet-writing-python-2-3-compatible-code).

### Installing Python and all useful packages
Slides on this topic start [here](http://slides.com/utstikkar/introtopython-pythonproglanguage#/10)

### Running the IPython interpreter and a python file
Slides on this topic start [here](http://slides.com/utstikkar/introtopython-pythonproglanguage#/12)

### IPython Notebook
A live demo will be given during the masterclass.

Experiment further with the IPython Notebook environment with [this IPython Notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/2.x/examples/Notebook/Running%20Code.ipynb)

Try to clone or download it, before opening it, running and modifying its cells.

### Python basics
Times to get your hands dirty. Read and test for yourself the examples provided in: [The SciPy Lectures -- The Python Language](http://scipy-lectures.github.io/intro/language/python_language.html).

Practice those examples using alternatively python files, the IPython interpreter and an IPython Notebook.

## NumPy and SciPy

### NumPy
Start with the official [NumPy Tutorial](http://wiki.scipy.org/Tentative_NumPy_Tutorial).

Move on to these [exercises](http://scipy-lectures.github.io/intro/numpy/exercises.html).

### Matplotlib
Learn the basics and some more advanced plotting tricks in Matplotlib with this [hands-on tutorial](http://scipy-lectures.github.io/intro/matplotlib/matplotlib.html).

### SciPy
SciPy is a collection of mathematical algorithms and convenience functions built on the Numpy extension of Python.

[Here](http://scipy-lectures.github.io/intro/scipy.html) is a hands-on overview of this collection, together with practical exercises and more advanced problems.

For those willing to go even further I recommend having a look at thise IPython Notebooks on [Effect Size](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks/blob/master/scipy/effect_size.ipynb), [Random Sampling](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks/blob/master/scipy/sampling.ipynb) and [Hypothesis Testing](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks/blob/master/scipy/hypothesis.ipynb).
