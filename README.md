A great [ipython notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rasbt/python_reference/blob/master/tutorials/key_differences_between_python_2_and_3.ipynb) covering the main differences has been written by Sebastian Raschka.

To keep your code compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3, you might also want to use [this Cheat Sheet](http://python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html#cheat-sheet-writing-python-2-3-compatible-code).
