## About me
Slides for this section can be found [here](https://slides.com/utstikkar/introtopython-aboutme).

## The Python Programming Language
Slide deck for this entire section is available [here](https://slides.com/utstikkar/introtopython-pythonproglanguage).

### Why Python?
Slides on this topic start [here](http://slides.com/utstikkar/introtopython-pythonproglanguage#/1)

### Python for DS Components
Slides on this topic start [here](http://slides.com/utstikkar/introtopython-pythonproglanguage#/5)

### Python 2 vs. Python 3
Slides on this topic start [here](http://slides.com/utstikkar/introtopython-pythonproglanguage#/6)

A great [ipython notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rasbt/python_reference/blob/master/tutorials/key_differences_between_python_2_and_3.ipynb) covering the main differences has been written by Sebastian Raschka.

To keep your code compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3, you might also want to use [this Cheat Sheet](http://python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html#cheat-sheet-writing-python-2-3-compatible-code).

### Installing Python and all useful packages
Slides on this topic start [here](http://slides.com/utstikkar/introtopython-pythonproglanguage#/10)

### Running the IPython interpreter and a python file
Slides on this topic start [here](http://slides.com/utstikkar/introtopython-pythonproglanguage#/12)

### IPython Notebook
A live demo will be given during the masterclass.

Experiment further with the IPython Notebook environment with [this IPython Notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/2.x/examples/Notebook/Running%20Code.ipynb)

Try to clone or download it, before opening it, running and modifying its cells.

### Python basics
Times to get your hands dirty. Read and test for yourself the examples provided in: [The SciPy Lectures -- The Python Language](http://scipy-lectures.github.io/intro/language/python_language.html)

Practice those examples using alternatively python files, the IPython interpreter and an IPython Notebook.
