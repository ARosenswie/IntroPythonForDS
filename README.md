## About me
Slides for this section can be found [here](https://slides.com/utstikkar/introtopython-aboutme).

## The Python Programming Language
Slide deck for this entire section is available [here](https://slides.com/utstikkar/introtopython-pythonproglanguage).

### Why Python?
Slides on this topic start [here](http://slides.com/utstikkar/introtopython-pythonproglanguage#/1)

### Python for DS Components
Slides on this topic start [here](http://slides.com/utstikkar/introtopython-pythonproglanguage#/5)

### Python 2 vs. Python 3
Slides on this topic start [here](http://slides.com/utstikkar/introtopython-pythonproglanguage#/6)

A great [notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rasbt/python_reference/blob/master/tutorials/key_differences_between_python_2_and_3.ipynb) covering the main differences has been written by Sebastian Raschka.

To keep your code compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3, you might also want to use [this Cheat Sheet](http://python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html#cheat-sheet-writing-python-2-3-compatible-code).

### Installing Python and all useful packages
Slides on this topic start [here](http://slides.com/utstikkar/introtopython-pythonproglanguage#/10)

### Running the IPython interpreter and a python file
Slides on this topic start [here](http://slides.com/utstikkar/introtopython-pythonproglanguage#/12)

### Jupyter Notebook
A live demo will be given during the masterclass.

Experiment further with the IPython Notebook environment with [this Jupyter Notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/2.x/examples/Notebook/Running%20Code.ipynb).
Try to clone or download it, before opening it, running and modifying its cells.

Many more Jupyter features in [this blog post](http://arogozhnikov.github.io/2016/09/10/jupyter-features.html).

### Python basics
Times to get your hands dirty. Read and test for yourself the examples provided in: [The SciPy Lectures -- The Python Language](http://scipy-lectures.github.io/intro/language/python_language.html).

Practice those examples using alternatively python files, the IPython interpreter and an IPython Notebook.

## Pandas 

### Intro tutorials on pandas basics

 * [Tutorial: Data structures](https://github.com/luciasantamaria/pandas-tutorial/blob/master/intro-to-pandas-1-Data-Structures.ipynb)
 * [Tutorial: Working with dataframes](https://github.com/luciasantamaria/pandas-tutorial/blob/master/intro-to-pandas-2-Working-With-DataFrames.ipynb)
 * [Tutorial: Using pandas on the MovieLens dataset](https://github.com/luciasantamaria/pandas-tutorial/blob/master/intro-to-pandas-3-Pandas-On-MovieLens.ipynb)

### Data munging with pandas

 * [Exercises](https://github.com/luciasantamaria/pandas-tutorial/blob/master/data-munging-with-pandas.ipynb)

## Scikit-learn

 * Introduction to machine learning with scikit-learn [slides](http://slides.com/luciasantamaria/intro-machine-learning-scikit-learn#/)
 * Doing machine learning with scikit-learn [slides](https://github.com/luciasantamaria/pandas-tutorial/blob/master/scikit-learn.pdf)
 * [General concepts on machine learning](http://www.astroml.org/sklearn_tutorial/general_concepts.html)
 * [Tutorial: Introduction to scikit-learn](https://github.com/luciasantamaria/pandas-tutorial/blob/master/intro-to-scikit-learn-1-Basics.ipynb)

## Your first data analysis case

A great source of data problems nowadays is the Kaggle platform. We'll be starting today with a simple but representative dataset: [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

 * [Guide](https://github.com/luciasantamaria/pandas-tutorial/blob/master/titanic-machine-learning.ipynb) for orientation to approach the problem

IMPORTANT: you will find plenty of materials to analyze this data, however you'll learn the most if you give the problem some thought and try out several things before resorting to ready-made answers.
